		<p> In 2006, Graydon Hoare was a 29-year-old computer programmer working for Mozilla, the open-source
			browser company. Returning home to his apartment in Vancouver, he found that the elevator was out of order;
			its software had crashed. This wasn't the first time it had happened, either. Hoare lived on the 21st floor,
			and as he climbed the stairs, he got annoyed. 'It's ridiculous,' he thought, 'that we computer people
			couldn't even make an elevator that works without crashing!' Many such crashes, Hoare knew, are due to
			problems with how a program uses memory. The software inside devices like elevators is often written in
			languages like C++ or C, which are famous for allowing programmers to write code that runs very quickly and
			is quite compact. The problem is those languages also make it easy to accidentally introduce memory
			bugs-errors that will cause a crash. Microsoft estimates that 70% of the vulnerabilities in its code are due
			to memory errors from code written in these languages. Most of us, if we found ourselves trudging up 21
			flights of stairs, would just get pissed off and leave it there. But Hoare decided to do something about it.
			He opened his laptop and began designing a new computer language, one that he hoped would make it possible
			to write small, fast code without memory bugs. He named it Rust, after a group of remarkably hardy fungi
			that are, he says, 'over-engineered for survival.'
