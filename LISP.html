		<li> LISP was created in 1959. </li>

		<li> LISP based languages are:
			<ol>
				<li> Clojure </li>
				<li> Emacs Lisp </li>
				<li> Common Lisp </li>
				<li> Julia </li>
				<li> Racket </li>
				<li> Scheme </li>

		<p> John McCarthy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology is credited with creating the first version of Lisp
			in 1959. The first official implementation of the language was performed on an IBM 704 mainframe using
			punched cards. Between the 1960s and 2000s, more than a dozen mainstream dialects were created and used in a
			variety of
			ways. Throughout the 1990s, Lisp's popularity began to fade as programmers opted for more modern programming
			languages. However, computer scientist and entrepreneur Paul Graham helped to create a resurgence in
			interest for Lisp. In an essay titled "Beating the Averages" written in the early 2000s, Graham wrote of his
			interest in using Lisp within his latest startup organization's software platform to create a competitive
			advantage over others. Graham stated: "Our hypothesis was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we'd be
			able to get features done faster than our competitors, and also to do things in our software that they
			couldn't do. And because Lisp was so high-level, we wouldn't need a big development team, so our costs would
			be lower." Many readers of the essay took this notion to heart, and thus the use of Lisp again.

		<p> Lisp's ability to compute with symbolic expressions rather than numbers makes it convenient for artificial
			intelligence (AI) applications.
