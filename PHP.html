		<li> PHP was created in 1994. </li>
		<br>

		<p> PHP is especially suited to web development. Websites that use PHP are Facebook, Wikipedia, WordPress, and
			Yahoo.</p>
		<br>

		<li> PHP can be used for:
			<ol>
				<li> Generating dynamic page content </li>
				<li> Creating, opening, reading, writing, deleting, and closing files on the server </li>
				<li> Collecting form data </li>
				<li> Sending and receiving cookies </li>
				<li> Adding, deleting, modifying data in your database </li>
				<li> Controling user-access </li>
				<li> Encrypting data </li>
			</ol>
		</li>

		<p> Early non-released versions were used on his home page to keep track of who was looking at his online
			resume. The first version used by others was available in 1995 and was known as the Personal Home Page
			Tools. It consisted of a very simplistic parser engine that only understood a few special macros and a
			number of utilities that were in common use on home pages back then. A guestbook, a counter and some other
			stuff. The parser was rewritten in mid-1995 and named PHP/FI Version 2. The FI came from another package
			Rasmus had written which interpreted html form data. He combined the Personal Home Page tools scripts with
			the Form Interpreter and added mSQL support and PHP/FI was born. PHP/FI grew at an amazing pace and people
			started contributing code to it. It is estimated that by late 1996 PHP was in use on at least 15,000 web
			sites around the world. By mid-1997 this number had grown to over 50,000. Mid-1997 also saw a change in the
			development of PHP. It changed from being Rasmus' own pet project that a handful of people had contributed
			to, to being a much more organized team effort. The parser was rewritten from scratch by Zeev Suraski and
			Andi Gutmans and this new parser formed the basis for PHP 3.0. A lot of the utility code from PHP was ported
			over to PHP3 and a lot of it was completely rewritten.
